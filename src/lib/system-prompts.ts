## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

### Integration Strategy:
- **Preserve Existing Information**: Keep all valid information from the previous summary
- **Merge Seamlessly**: Integrate new content without creating redundancy
- **Maintain Structure**: Follow the same organizational format as the original
- **Update Chronologically**: Ensure the flow remains chronological
- **Resolve Conflicts**: If new information contradicts old, note both with timestamps/context

### Content Handling:
- **Evolutionary Updates**: Show how topics, decisions, or technical details evolved
- **New Discoveries**: Highlight new topics, solutions, or insights clearly
- **Status Changes**: Update the status of pending items or unresolved questions
- **Contextual Awareness**: Understand how new messages relate to previous discussions

### Quality Assurance:
- Maintain the same concise yet comprehensive style
- Ensure no information loss from either source
- Keep technical details precise and complete
- Preserve all code, configurations, and specific technical information
- Update user preferences or constraints if they've changed

## INPUTS:

### PREVIOUS SUMMARY:
${previous_summary}

### NEW CONVERSATION CONTENT:
${messages.join("\n")}

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Update the summary using this structure:

**Main Topics Discussed:**
- [Merge previous topics with new ones, noting evolution]
- [Add completely new topics clearly marked]

**Technical Details:**
- [Combine all technical information chronologically]
- [Note any updates, fixes, or changes to previous implementations]

**Decisions & Outcomes:**
- [Update previous decisions if they changed]
- [Add new decisions and their outcomes]
- [Note if previous solutions were modified or replaced]

**Pending Items:**
- [Update status of previous pending items]
- [Add new unresolved questions or tasks]
- [Remove items that were completed in new messages]

**Context Notes:**
- [Maintain user profile information]
- [Update project context if it evolved]
- [Note any new constraints or preferences]

## INTEGRATION GUIDELINES:
1. **If new content extends a topic**: Merge smoothly, showing progression
2. **If new content contradicts previous info**: Present both with context about when each was relevant
3. **If new content resolves pending items**: Move them to "Decisions & Outcomes" section
4. **If new content is completely unrelated**: Add as separate topics while maintaining flow

Generate an updated summary that represents the complete conversation history accurately and would enable seamless conversation continuation.`;

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

### Structure & Organization:
- Create a hierarchical summary with clear topic sections
- Use bullet points for key information within each topic
- Maintain strict chronological flow of discussion
- Separate facts from opinions/preferences clearly

### Content Preservation:
- **Code & Technical Details**: Preserve all code snippets, file names, error messages, and technical configurations exactly
- **Decisions & Outcomes**: Highlight all decisions made, solutions found, and their effectiveness
- **User Preferences**: Note user's stated preferences, constraints, and requirements
- **Context Continuity**: Include enough detail for seamless conversation resumption
- **Action Items**: Extract any pending tasks, follow-ups, or unresolved questions

### Quality Standards:
- Be comprehensive but concise (aim for 150-300 words)
- Use precise, unambiguous language
- Include specific details that matter (numbers, names, versions, dates)
- Avoid redundancy while ensuring completeness
- Write in third person, objective tone

## CONVERSATION TO SUMMARIZE:
${messages.join("\n")}

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Structure your summary as:

**Main Topics Discussed:**
- Topic 1: [Brief description with key points]
- Topic 2: [Brief description with key points]

**Technical Details:**
- Code/configurations discussed
- Tools, libraries, or technologies mentioned
- Specific implementations or solutions

**Decisions & Outcomes:**
- What was decided or resolved
- Solutions that worked/didn't work
- User's final choices or preferences

**Pending Items:**
- Unresolved questions or issues
- Planned next steps or follow-ups
- Areas requiring further discussion

**Context Notes:**
- User's skill level, role, or background (if mentioned)
- Project context or constraints
- Important preferences or requirements

- Does it reference specific data, code, or content that would be in files?
